heading: We love to get to know how your business ticks. Moreover, we love to help you find ways to make it tick smoother, faster and become reliable. This is where our application development service offering comes in. Starting with a blank canvas and a problem statement, we’re able to create something from nothing and, more often than not, completely revolutionise the way your business operates - for the better!

## Web Applications
The web, the internet, or even the cloud, whatever your chosen name, it’s not going anywhere. We believe everything we currently complete and save to our devices, will eventually be done online.

This is why we specialise in creating bespoke web based applications, unique to solving your specific needs. Our applications can be accessible from anywhere in the world (where there’s internet) if you’d like them to be. Or, they can be “locked down” to specific locations such as your office or home.

Written using the most up to date technologies including Javascript (specifically React & Node.js), PHP, MongoDB, MySQL and more. You can be sure you’re in safe hands when working with us.

## Mobile Applications
Much like how the internet has disrupted many industries and created more opportunities than we care to realise, the introduction of the smartphone only amplifies this disruption further. Nowadays it’s fully plausible that a company, possibly any company, could be run mostly from a smartphone device.

With the computing power of these devices only on the rise, what can be achieved from having your own mobile application for your company is growing exponentially. What’s more, the creation of a bespoke mobile application can also work seamlessly with your bespoke web application.

## Integrations
Already use one or many online tools/applications in your day-to-day? Frustrated by having to copy & paste information between them because you can’t find a way for them to talk to one another? We think we can help.

The likelihood of a web based system not having an API (Application Programming Interface) these days is slim to none. What’s an API, I hear you ask? An API allows us to carry out the same actions you might complete as a human, but with code. Why is this useful? It usually means we can either fully or at least partially automate a lot of tasks which you’re currently doing manually.
